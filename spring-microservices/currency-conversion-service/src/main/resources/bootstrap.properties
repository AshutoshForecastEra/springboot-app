#Ribbon will use the list of servers from here to distribute the load and CurrencyConversionProxy would no longer need to hardcode the server url for FeignClient
#currency-exchange-service.ribbon.listOfServers=http://localhost:8000,http://localhost:8001,http://localhost:8002

#When talking to eureka naming server (see config 'eureka.client.service-url.default-zone' below), this 'currency-exchange-service.ribbon.listOfServers' config 
# is not required as currency conversion service, currency exchange service etc. have registered them with eureka naming server.
#How connection to exchange service is working now? -> Earlier ribbon was dependent on 'currency-exchange-service.ribbon.listOfServers' config
# to connect to currency exchange service, when we integrated with netflix eureka naming server, 
# now Ribbon will talk to naming server instead of directly depending on 'currency-exchange-service.ribbon.listOfServers' config.
#Ribbon will ask naming server (eureka), what all instances of currency-exchange-service are registered with you. Eureka will return the list
# of registered currency-exchange-service instances. Now ribbon will invoke the instances by balancing the load.

#As we know, Ribbon is a client-side load balancer that gives you a lot of control over the behavior of HTTP and TCP clients.
